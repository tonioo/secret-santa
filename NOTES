1. I'm not sure if the API is supposed to be used by multiple users but I guess so. That's why I added the Santalist model...
2. Since there was not indication about unicity of participants within the same list, I'm using primary keys most of the time to identify them
3. No authentication at the moment, is it something to add in the future?
4. No way to close a list for now, it's possible to add new participants while there are existing draws already...
